# Oat milk recipe

Since starting the [zero waste challenge](https://changeitup.org.uk/zero-waste-food-packaging/), I realised that a large proportion of my weekly waste was oat milk cartons. So, I set out to start making my own. It's easy, cheap, and produces no waste at all. I fiddled around with a few recipes online and this is my tried and tested version. Let me know if you give it a go!

## Ingredients (makes 750ml)
- 3.5 cups / 875 ml of water
- 1 date
- 1 cup / 250 ml of oats
- 1 tbsp rapeseed oil
- Pinch of salt

## Equipment
- Blender
- Fine mesh sieve
- Jug
- Bottle or other airtight pourable container

*Blitzing the date*

## Method

1. Put the date, minus stone, into a blender with the water and the salt. Blend for about 30 seconds. The date should have completely broken down.

2. Add the other ingredients (oats, oil) to the blender. Blend for 30 seconds only. This is important, as longer blending results in a slimy texture.

3. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve. As the oat bran builds up in the sieve, spoon the bran into a separate container. You can use the bran in cooking (maybe try these vegan cookies) or just eat it for breakfast with a banana and some seeds like I do. 

4. I pour the mixture into a jug and then pour from the jug into a kilner bottle, where it lives in the fridge until itâ€™s all gone. 

5. And there you have it: homemade oat milk! 

### Options
The salt and the date are optional extras for taste. The oil is an optional extra for consistency and stability, especially if using the milk in hot drinks. For an even creamier milk, reduce the water to 3 cups and add an extra tablespoon of oil. You can make a super simple milk just with oats and water.
