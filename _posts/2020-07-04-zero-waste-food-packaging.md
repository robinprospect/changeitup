## What's the problem?

It probably sounds naive but, until recently, I didn’t think much about what happened to my household waste after it was collected by the council. I was pretty rigorous with my recycling basket (no yoghurt pot was allowed to sneak into the black bin bag). Wasn’t that enough? 

Then I began to hear more about ships laden with waste crossing the globe to dump the UK’s problem on other countries, which struggle to cope with the demand. Seeing photographs of the surface of the sea covered in plastic waste drove home the impact our consumption habits can have on the planet. 

I started to notice how much I discarded every week into the recycling basket or, if not recyclable, the rubbish bin. I paid more attention to the maxim “Reduce, Reuse, Repair and Recycle”, with a dawning recognition that it is in that order for a reason. 

Throwaway plastic packaging makes up 40% of the demand for plastic and is the fastest-growing segment of the [plastic economy](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/15/single-use-plastics-a-serious-climate-change-hazard-study-warns). The manufacture, transportation and waste management of single-use plastics all emit damaging carbon. Simply swapping to plastic alternatives [doesn’t solve the problem either](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/09/735848489/plastic-has-a-big-carbon-footprint-but-that-isnt-the-whole-story). Reducing the rate at which we churn through materials has got to be better for the Earth.

## What can we do? 

Personal accountability is an important principle of Change It Up. We are not, as individuals, responsible for most of the harm caused to the Earth. However, there are some choices that are ours to make. In fact, many, and on a daily basis. If we mindfully reduce our own impact on the world, it will become easier to understand the causes of the larger problems and to use our collective power to demand systemic change.

Changemakers want to know how to minimise their footprint: when we polled the Change It Up Facebook group, most respondents wanted to know how to move towards zero waste at home. So, we connected a zero waste expert with a keen tester to make some changes.

## The zero waste challenge

Our expert for this challenge is Kay Holford. Kay has been moving towards zero waste at home for several years. Initially this was driven by necessity. A dramatic reduction in income, due to poor health, meant that every purchasing decision had to be considered. Now, creating practical no-waste solutions is a way of life. She says there was a moment of recognition that often she didn’t need to buy stuff; it was just a habit. So, by changing habits bit by bit, she has moved away from a consumerist value system and towards properly considered and functional sustainability. 

Kay aims for zero waste in all areas of her life, and clearly takes pride in her avoidance of consumer culture. She showed us around her home, enthusiastically pointing out cupboards full of refilled glass jars, shelves stacked with takeaway containers repurposed to store crafty trinkets, and secondhand gadgets (including a SodaStream, which, I’ll be honest, filled me with childish excitement). 

We spent a few hours learning about the ways Kay has transformed her habits over the years, and I left with the impression that we could have come back several times for more tips. This blog post focuses on food and food packaging, but you’ll see Kay’s zero waste advice cropping up in future blogs covering other common household items. 

Kay’s key resources are space and time. Many people, however, lack these things. Our tester for this challenge, Michi, falls into this category. Michi has a full time job which leaves limited time and energy for other activities. She shares a flat with two other people and was quite conscious of not wanting to impose her views on her flatmates. On the other hand, for Michi it was feasible to spend a certain amount of money to avoid creating waste. I wondered how Michi would take Kay’s advice and apply it in her, quite different, circumstances. 

## Michi's commitment to reducing her waste

After our meeting with Kay, Micol spent some time reviewing her current consumption habits and identifying the biggest sources of waste. She then considered which steps were feasible and sustainable for her (pre-lockdown!) life. From the tips below, she selected actions that she would take for one month. These were:

1. Avoid heavily packaged food from the supermarket by choosing:
- Loose fruit and veg 
- Meat from the butchers
- Bread from the bakery
- Work week lunch from the bakery
2. Avoid small plastic bottled soft drinks, replacing them either with homemade SodaStream drinks, cans or bigger bottles
3. Make oat milk instead of buying it in cartons
4. Cook food in bulk and freeze in portions, to avoid buying ready meals
5. Only buy convenience food such as ready meals if they are in the reduced section or the Too Good To Go app
6. Reuse takeaway containers 

## The report

Pre-lockdown, when Michi used to work in an office, she was enjoying using [Too Good To Go](https://toogoodtogo.co.uk/en-gb) at lunchtimes, to rescue food that would otherwise go in the bin. This app alerts you to local cafes, shops and restaurants that have spare food you can collect at set times. You won’t know exactly what you’re getting, as it depends what they have left over, but that is quite fun and you pay substantially less than full price. If nothing took her fancy on TGTG, Michi was visiting a bakery where she could get packaging-free convenience food. 

Well, then lockdown happened. Consumer choice was not a thing for a while. If the supermarket had it, we bought it, because we didn’t know if we’d ever come across wholewheat pasta again. 

As weeks became months, shops sorted out their supply chains and mostly returned to normal. Our lives are still very different but, for those of us lucky enough to have secure incomes and health, this isn’t all bad. I caught up with Michi in May and heard how the lockdown conditions have enabled her to embed positive changes into her routines and reduce packaging waste. 

The big win for Michi has been learning to cook from scratch. Let me tell you a secret: Michi is a fun person. She used to go out fairly often. Now events are a thing of the past, she has to find pastimes to keep herself entertained. As it turns out, planning and cooking her own meals has been surprisingly fun and easy. She’s completely given up ready meals (with all their throwaway packaging)! Michi has been getting recipes from friends, and also just improvising. An added incentive is that if she cooks, a housemate has to clear up!

Michi is an omnivore who aims to be vegan at some point, so is part of the growing ‘flexitarian’ movement. She is cooking vegan meals regularly and buying meat less (which significantly reduces her carbon footprint). She recommends this approach: 

> Aim high and you’ll see a lot of beneficial changes along the way even if you don’t make it.

A major driver behind Michi’s new love of cooking has been the switch to buying loose vegetables and fruit from the market. She notes that it is so much nicer than supermarket veg. Market produce is also substantially cheaper, meaning eating more vegetables everyday has become more achievable. 

Takeaways are a once-a-week treat, and Michi keeps the containers to store homemade leftovers or other bits and pieces in the kitchen. 

In the shops, Michi has been trying to avoid packaging, especially plastic. She has been making choices such as: cans instead of plastic bottles; reusable glass containers instead of plastic; single items instead of multipacks that are double packed in plastic.  

Michi notes that it can be impossible for the consumer to avoid plastic. Manufacturers could, in many cases, be pressured into making better choices (e.g. customers could leave critical reviews on supermarket websites where unnecessary packaging is used). Dried pasta, for example, is sold in cardboard boxes in Italy where Michi grew up. 

Where it isn’t possible to avoid packaging, Michi has also been experimenting with making her own. We swapped tips for making dips, with Michi recommending homemade guacamole and me waxing lyrical about the infinite varieties of hummus I’ve imposed on my flatmate. 

The biggest success, for both of us, has been making our own oat milk. Oat milk is a winner on every front. If you use a lot of milk (the cereal eaters or compulsive latte drinkers) you get through several cartons of shop-bought a week. Making oat milk is really easy, extremely cheap, and zero waste. 

I’ve played with a few recipes. Michi enjoys making oat milk at its very simplest, which is just oats whizzed up with water. It is one of the easiest vegan transitions for omnivores, as it is such a close replacement for cow milk. It has also been shown to be, environmentally, [the friendliest milk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46654042).

Michi says that although she knew it wasn't going to be perfect, she's happy with the changes she has made through this challenge. She feels that good habits have been formed and she can see herself continuing on this journey in the future. The largest reductions in waste have come from buying loose vegetables and making oat milk. 

Why not follow Michi's example? Pick some actions that you can commit to for a month, and see what sticks.

⌛ = actions to consider if you have time to spare
💰 = actions to consider if you need to save money

## Reduce
Think about reducing waste when you're making buying and cooking decisions.

### 1. Buy food without or with less packaging
- Markets and grocers usually sell fruit and veg without packaging, unlike most supermarkets. 💰
- If you are able to cook using fresh food, you'll get through less packaging. Save time, money and energy by cooking several portions at once and freezing some. ⌛

- Buying food in larger quantities, e.g. from a wholesaler, can reduce the amount of packaging going in the bin. 💰
- Say no to single use plastics such as straws and single serving condiments.


### 2. Rescue food that's heading for the bin
- 'Best before' dates can be ignored!
- There are several apps that allow neighbours to advertise unwanted edibles, such as Olio and Nextdoor. [Zero Waste Near Me](https://www.zerowastenear.me/) also lists community fridges. Treasures I've spotted include sourdourgh starters and unwanted rhubarb! 💰 ⌛
- [Approved Food](https://www.approvedfood.co.uk/) sells surplus and short-dated food and drink from major brands at a discount. They even do deliveries. 💰
- [Oddbox](https://www.oddbox.co.uk/) rescues fruit and veg at risk of becoming food waste. Deliveries come in cardboard boxes and usually contain no plastic.
- [Too Good To Go](https://toogoodtogo.co.uk/en-gb) alerts you to local cafes, shops and restaurants that have spare food. You collect a 'magic bag' at set times. You won’t know exactly what you’re getting, as it depends what they have left over, but that’s quite fun and you pay substantially less than full price. I used it to pick up 3 meals from Agdu, an Ethiopian cafe a short walk from home. I was warned that they occasionally do run out of food and therefore can’t fulfil the order. It isn’t clear whether there would be any warning notification in the app if that happens. The servings came in plastic takeaway tubs. My friend Fran suggested that I could take in my own tupperware (or even their plastic tubs) next time. Great idea, I will give it a go! Maybe this could become as much of a habit as carrying a keep cup for coffee. 💰
- Take inspiration from zero waste podcasts or videos, such as [Max La Manna's vegan, zero waste youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MaxLaMannazerowastechef/featured).


### 3. Make your own
- What packaging ends up in your bin most often? Could you make your own version? ⌛ 💰
- Making oat milk is easy, quick and an excellent replacement for other milks. 💰
- If you're a fizzy drink fiend, look out for a secondhand SodaStream! 


### 4. Grow or pick your own
- If you have a spare windowsill, consider growing your own herbs. Basil is easy to grow from seed. If you buy a growing herb from a shop, separate the stems into a few containers so that they will have more space. 💰
- Take your own tubs to a 'pick your own' farm, with friends or family, and learn more about how food is produced as well as avoiding packaging. ⌛


## Reuse
- Refill shops are popping up around the UK, allowing you to bring in your empty bottles and tubs, and selling a good range of basics. The pricing varies a lot. My local refill shop is very cheap for spices and oil, but iniquitous for chick peas! You can find your nearest refill shop, as well as other zero waste initiatives, at [Zero Waste Near Me](https://www.zerowastenear.me/). ⌛
- Ensure you have reusable coffee cups, water bottles, grocery bags and tupperware to hand when you might need them. 💰
- Download the [Refill](https://refill.org.uk/get-the-refill-app/) app to find free drinking water sources across the UK. 💰
- Replace clingfilm with reusable wraps such as beeswax wraps, which you can buy or [make yourself](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/craft-ideas/g25642328/diy-beeswax-reusuable-wraps/), [sandwich wraps](re-wrap-it.co.uk), and 'fit anything' lids. Or just cover a bowl with a plate! 💰
- Choose products with reusable packaging, e.g. nice jars. 


## Recycle 
- Research your local recycling capabilities and keep a note of them (stick it to your fridge?)
- Ask your family and friends to recycle items that are accepted in their area but not yours. 
- [TerraCycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-GB/) is an awesome global company that manages networks of alternative recycling for hard-to-recycle products such as crisp packets and toothpaste tubes. You can find your local drop-off point on their website, or volunteer to host a drop-off point at your home or office. ⌛
- If you're feeling creative, you can make [ecobricks](https://www.ecobricks.org/) from your plastic film waste and use them to build furniture!
- Some packaging can be added to your food waste / compost (thin film made from cornstarch or mushrooms).
- Some packaging is only industrially compostable and your council may not have access to those facilities.
