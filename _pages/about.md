My name is Robin Prospect. Iâ€™m a barrister, working and living in London, and aiming to make the most of life. I founded Change It Up in February 2020. Change It Up was born out of a brunch where, contentedly full of delicious food, I was interrogating my smart friend who works for a social enterprise. I wanted to know how to live a more sustainable life, and she had some actual answers for me. We discussed how great it would be to capture this knowledge and make it widely available. Suddenly, the floodgates of my mind opened and I realised that my community is packed full of knowledgeable people who want to make the world a better place.  

> Change It Up is here because there is a powerful collective will to make positive changes: in ourselves, in our communities, and for the planet. 

There is a huge amount of knowledge in our networks about how positive changes can be made. Change It Up enables sharing of this knowledge. We talk to experts - who might be you -, do the research and road test practical changes. We share the TL;DR (too long, didn't read) clear steps that you can take. We write up our working in long form blog posts to enable you to follow our thinking.

Here is a flavour of the change challenges that are within the scope of this project: replacing dairy in our diets; reducing household waste; making bread; living in community; giving away money effectively; volunteering in a local project. And loads more... If you've thought of a change that would have a positive impact on individuals, society or the planet, we'd like to cover it, eventually!

We are currently getting a few change challenges up and running. The reports will be posted here once the challenges have been completed. If you want to be involved in the meantime, you can join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/645681219333097), where we recruit testers and post the latest updates.
